		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Growing up, I did not have much exposure to the opportunities offered by STEAM careers. Becasue of this, I have developed a passion for introducing STEAM to pre-college students. Over the past couple of years, I have worked with many students between the ages of five and seventeen. I prefer to use STEAM over STEM because not only are the arts/humanities important on their own, but they also play a big role in the STEM areas that many people aren't aware of. Additionally, I do not like the idea that STEM careers are better than non-STEM careers, and would like to work to break down the <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=stem+superiority+complex&oq=stem+superiority+complex&aqs=chrome..69i57.4580j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">STEM superiority complex.</a></p>

		<h3>Brite Summer Program</h3>
		<p>Over the summer of 2020 I participated in a three week program by Brite and <a href = "https://www.worldscienceu.com">World Science U</a> that was designed to introduce middle school and high school girls to possible STEM careers. I helped the girls navigate the course, facilitated group discussions over Zoom, and answered their questions. Each week of the program had its own theme: Art x Science, Danger!, and Mind Matters.</p>
