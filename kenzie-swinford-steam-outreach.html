		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Growing up, I did not have much exposure to the opportunities offered by STEAM careers. Becasue of this, I have developed a passion for introducing STEAM to pre-college students. Over the past couple of years, I have worked with many students between the ages of five and seventeen. I prefer to use STEAM over STEM because not only are the arts/humanities important on their own, but they also play a big role in the STEM areas that many people aren't aware of. Additionally, I do not like the idea that STEM careers are better than non-STEM careers, and would like to work to break down the <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=stem+superiority+complex&oq=stem+superiority+complex&aqs=chrome..69i57.4580j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">STEM superiority complex.</a></p>

		<h3>MSOE STEM Programming</h3>
		<p>I am a STEM Program Assistant for MSOE's <a href = "https://www.msoe.edu/academics/stem-community-programs">STEM Outreach Department.</a> I test program kits, gather the materials, make presentations, and help the students during the programs.</p>

		<h3>Brite Summer Program</h3>
		<p>Over the summer of 2020 I participated in a three week program by Brite and <a href = "https://www.worldscienceu.com">World Science U</a> that was designed to introduce middle school and high school girls to possible STEM careers. I helped the girls navigate the course, facilitated group discussions over Zoom, and answered their questions. Each week of the program had its own theme: Art x Science, Danger!, and Mind Matters.</p>

		<h3>Shutting Down the STEM Superiority Complex</h3>
		<p>I do not believe that STEM is more important than the humanities, nor do I believe that the humanities are more important than STEM. I simply believe that both are equally important and necessary. The opinions provided below are soley my own that I have come up with based on my experiences with both STEM and the humanities, talking to other poeple in both fields, and listening to others speak on the issue. Feel free to read about my opinions if you wish, but do not use them as reason for argument. Instead, use them as inspiration for your own research about the STEM superiority complex. This list may contain more about how the humanities are related to STEM because my career falls into the STEM category and I therefore know more about it. If you would like to chat about this issue or provide your own insight, feel free to reach out.</p>
		<p>Please <a href = "mailto:swinfordkenzie@gmail.com?subject=STEM%20Superiority%20Complex">email me</a> if you would like to discuss this issue further.</p>
		<details>
			<summary>My Opinions</summary>
			<p>This list is not exhaustive of my beliefs. When I have time, I hope to include links to other websites that further explains each belief. If you would like to provide your own ideas, please contact me. All ideas are my own unless otherwise noted. My ideas should not be used as arguments or proof, and should instead be used as inspiration for your own research.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Would not have society without the humanities because we wouldn't be able to communicate or interact with one another</li>
				<li>Cannot have STEM without the humanities becasue scientific discoveries or new products would not be able to be shared with the public</li>
				<li>Would not be able to solve social problems without the humanities because the humanities focus on these problems (more than STEM) and why these problems exist (sexism, racism, classism, homelessness, poverty, etc.)
					<ul>
						<li>Not saying these issues can't be helped by STEM, but STEM generally does not look into the root of the issues.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The argument that STEM makes life and the humanities make life worth living is invalid because the humanities have a role in making life, and STEM has a part in making life worth living.</li>
