		<h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
		<p>The most unforgettable memory I have from my childhood is trying to stick Elmo stickers on my father's hot pink street rod. I remember my dad rushing over asking what I was doing, and when I told him I was trying to make his car "more pretty", he instead led me to his rusty truck. Together, we stuck Elmo stickers on the passenger side door where they remained for years until the Dakota's final days. This amusing event was just the beginning of my enthusiasm for the automobile.</p>
		<p>Growing up, I went to car shows with my parents, watched NHRA drag racing with my dad, held flashlights while my father worked on his 1938 Dodge, and even continuted my interest for automotive design by teaching myself pinstriping. Over the years, my dad and I had frequent conversations about paint jobs, interior colors, grills, wheel design, and more, and on occasion I would ask about how some of the performance parts work. I had always thought of the mechanical components as confusing and did not think I would be able to understand. One day while we were talking, I asked my dad how an engine worked, and his explanation stuck with me. Even though I did not fully understand, I found it fascinating that the components worked together to convert energy into motion. I decided to investigate careers that would allow me to continue exploring this interest, which is how I stumbled upon, and eventually chose, mechanical engineering.</p>

		<h3>Computer Science</h3>
		<p>I had settled on mechanical engineering by the beginning of my senior year. Since cars are what sparked my interest in the first place, I wanted to take Automotive Awareness to learn more about how the vehicle works. However, the class did not fit into my schedule. I was bummed, but I decided to fill that credit with an online class, Foundations of Computer Programming. It sounding engineering related, so even though I had no idea what computer programming was, I decided to give it a go. I finished both semesters in less than one semester and enjoyed every second of it. The following semester I signed up for AP Computer Science online, and that only strengthened my interest. From that point on, I knew I wanted my career to involve computer science, but I also still wanted to do mechanical engineering. I kept my major as mechanical engineering, but during my freshman year at MSOE, I took Introduction to Mechatronics where I learned about the intersection of mechanical engineering and computer programming. That trimester I submitted a request to add computer science as a second major.</p>

		<h4>ME1301 Mechatronics Final Project</h4>
		<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hybe7OJD1oQ&t=35s">Mechatronics Final Project Video</a><br>
		<p>This project was completed for ME1301 Mechatronics taken during the spring quarter of my freshman year. I was given a list of required and optional hardware, along with software requirements. More information about the project is available on the teacher's website, <a href = "https://www.larsmaxfield.com/me_1301/project">larsmaxfield.com</a>.</p>

			<summary>Project Proposal</summary>
			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this project is to display how much force is exerted by a robotic arm made up of three servo motors. The robotic arm was designed, and 3D printed by Kenzie Swinford. The end of the robotic arm does not have a gripper; it instead has a pointed end that is used to press a force-sensing resistor. The three-axis robotic arm is controlled with a potentiometer and moves so that the pointed end moves horizontally and parallel to the surface. The voltage read by the force-resisting sensor is then output using NeoPixels. The number of lit up NeoPixels corresponds to the amount of voltage read by the FSR.</p>
			<h4>Hardware</h4>
			<h5>x3 Standard Servo Motors</h5>
			<p>The three standard servos are used to move a robotic arm such that the pointed end of the robotic arm moves parallel to the surface, at a constant height, and in a straight line from its starting position to a force sensor.</p>
			<h5>x1 Potentiometer</h5>
			<p>The potentiometer is used to control the position of the robotic arm’s pointed end along the horizontal axis. Turning the potentiometer to the left will result in “forward” motion of the robotic arm and turning the potentiometer to the right will result in “backward” motion of the robotic arm.</p>
			<h5>x1 Force-Sensing Resistor</h5>
			<p>The FSR is placed at the end of the robotic arm’s path so that once the pointed end reaches the FSR, it will press the FSR, and its voltage will be recorded. The user inputs a maximum voltage for the FSR. If the FSR reads the maximum volage, the robotic arm will not be allowed to move in the “forward” direction (toward the FSR) and will only be able to move in the “backward” direction. Once the robotic arm is backed off the FSR, it is free to move in the “forward” direction.</p>
			<h5>x1 Adafruit Neopixel Strip</h5>
			<p>The NeoPixel strip acts as a status bar to display how much voltage is read by the FSR. The ratio of voltage read by the FSR to the maximum FSR voltage will be displayed as NeoPixels in blue. If the voltage is greater than or equal to the maximum voltage, the last NeoPixel will turn on in red.</p>
			<h5>x2 Pushbuttons</h5>
			<p>One pushbutton will completely end the program (will need to “Run” the program again for it to do anything.) The other pushbutton will act as a “reset” button. The first push of the “reset” button will suspend the system so that the robotic arm does not move and turning the potentiometer does nothing. Pushing the “reset” button again will start up the system again with the robotic arm in its “initial” position. There is no limit to the number of “resets” the system can go through.</p>
