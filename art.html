		<p>I have been passionate about art since elementary school, and was even planning to major in art or architecture before deciding on engineering.</p><br>
		<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic I was bored and needed something to do after I lost my internship, so I decided to start selling my art through Etsy, Redbubble, Instagram, and Facebook. I also occasionally do commissioned work, but commissions are closed for now since I am in school. I also do not currently have anything for sale in my Etsy shop, but will hopefully have some pieces up by the start of summer!</p>
