			<summary>University Scholars Honors Program</summary>
			<p>I was chosen to participate in MSOE's <a href = "https://www.msoe.edu/admissions-aid/undergraduate-admissions/freshman-honors-program/">University Scholars Honors Program</a> my freshman year. Through this program I worked on a project which aimed at bringing attention and recognition to the underground railroad in Milwaukee during the times of slavery. We worked to get this project going by conducting research about the underground railroad, brainstorming ideas for a memorial, and creating the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/mke-underground-railroad/home">MKE Underground Railroad Project</a> website.</p>

			<h4>Coursera</h4>
			<p>The summer after my freshman year of college I was supposed to begin work as a research and development intern. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic this internship was cancelled and I was unable to find another one. I wanted to work on a project and had always been interested in web design, so I decided to take a course through <a href = "https://www.coursera.org">Coursera.</a> This course, Introduction to HTML5, is the reason for the creation of this website.</p>

		<h3>Future</h3>
		<p>After graduating from MSOE, my current plan is grad school. I'm not quite sure whether I want to pursue a Master's Degree or a PhD. If I decide that grad school is not for me, I will hopefully find a job in either the automotive industry or robotics.</p>
