		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Growing up, I did not learn much about the opportunities offered by STEM careers, but I do not consider that to be bad. It allowed me to explore many different career interests such as art, architecture, automotives, and automotive painting. Before deciding on mechanical engineering, I wanted to be an automotive shop owner/painter, an artist, a theater set designer, and an architect, and I do not regret those experiences at all. However, I do also understand the importance of giving children access to information on STEM careers so that they have the time to explore and decide for themselves whether or not it would be a good fit. Becasue of my own background and interests, I have developed a passion for introducing STEM to pre-college students, while also helping them keep an open mind about other non-STEM careers. Over the last couple of years I have worked a couple of jobs related to childcare and outreach, and have been working to improve my mentorship to become a better role model for the students I am working with.</p>

		<h4><a href = "https://www.msoe.edu/academics/stem-community-programs">MSOE STEM Programming</a></h4>
		<p>Since September 2019 I have worked for MSOE's STEM Outreach Department as a STEM Program Assistant. My job includes testing program kits, assembling program kits, and assisting during the actual programs. My favorite part of the job is being able to answer students' questions about my experiences as an engineering major.</p>

		<h4>Brite Online Summer Program</h4>
		<p>During the summer of 2020 I participated in a three week program run by Brite and <a href = "https://www.worldscienceu.com">World Science U</a> that was designed to introduce middle school and high school girls to possible STEM careers. I worked as an Educator Assistant by helping the girls navigate the course, facilitating group discussions over Zoom, and answering questions. Each week of the program had its own theme: Art x Science, Danger!, and Mind Matters. During Art x Science, they learned about the intersection of art and science and heard from women currently working in both industries. Druing Danger!, the girls learned about dangerous jobs within STEM, and during Mind Matters they learned about careers realted to the brain and the mind.</p>

		<h4><a href = "https://www.bgclubpc.org/">Boys &amp; Girls Club</a></h4>
		<p>Over the summer of 2019 I worked as a Program Leader for the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Portage County. I led elementary school children through STEM, Arts &amp; Crafts, Cooking, and Reading programs.</p>

		<h4>STEM Superiority Complex</h4>
		<p>One aspect of the STEM community that I am trying to work on is the idea that STEM careers are superior to all other careers, especially those within humanities. I believe that the idea of STEM being superior is damaging to society. I am working to break down this superiority complex by checking myself and my thoughts to make sure that I am not thinking negatively about non-STEM majors. I am also making sure that when I talk with children about possible career opportunities that I do not speak down on non-STEM paths and provide positive thoughts on other careers that may come up. Additionally, I am trying to speak up when I hear my peers talking negatively about non-STEM careers.</p>
