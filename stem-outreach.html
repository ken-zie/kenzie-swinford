		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>
			Growing up, I did not learn much about the opportunities offered by STEM careers, 
			but I do not consider that to be bad. It allowed me to explore many different 
			career interests such as art, architecture, automotives, and automotive painting. 
			Before deciding on mechanical engineering, I wanted to be an automotive shop 
			owner/painter, an artist, a theater set designer, and an architect, and I do not 
			regret those experiences at all. However, I do also understand the importance of 
			giving children access to information on STEM careers so that they have the time 
			to explore and decide for themselves whether or not it would be a good fit. 
			Becasue of my own background and interests, I have developed a passion for 
			introducing STEM to pre-college students, while also helping them keep an open 
			mind about other non-STEM careers. Over the last couple of years I have worked 
			many jobs related to childcare and outreach, and have been working to improve 
			my mentorship to become a better role model for the students I am working with.

		<h4><a href = "https://www.msoe.edu/academics/stem-community-programs">MSOE STEM Programming</a></h4>
		<p>
			Since September 2019 I have worked for MSOE's STEM Outreach Department as a STEM 
			Program Assistant. My job includes testing program kits, assembling program kits, 
			and assisting during the actual programs. My favorite part of the job is being 
			able to answer students' questions about my experiences as an engineering major. 
			Currently, I am working on creating a Google Slides presentation to teach the 
			basics of Arduino by providing basic hardware and coding concepts, example 
			problems, and application problems. The presentation covers turning on an LED,
			blinking an LED, turning on and dimming an RGB LED, using a piezoelectric buzzer, 
			using a potentiometer, using the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE, contorlling 
			hardware with a potentiometer, using servo motors, and controlling a servo motor
			with a potentiometer.

		<h4>NASA RMC Lunaboitics Outreach</h4>
		<p>
			I am a member of the MSOE NASA RMC Lunabotics organziation, and part of our 
			requirements for NASA in order to compete in the spring is to for our organziation
			to do STEM Outreach. I joined the STEM Outreah Committee in the fall of 2020, and 
			we are working on putting together STEM programs for elementary and middle school
			children. I am working to put together a program to teach elementary students about
			UV light, why NASA cares about UV light, and the dangers of UV light through a 
			video and PowerPoint presentation, and a hands on activity.

		<h4>Brite Online Summer Program</h4>
		<p>
			During the summer of 2020 I participated in a three week program run by Brite and 
			<a href = "https://www.worldscienceu.com">World Science U</a> that was designed to 
			introduce middle school and high school girls to possible STEM careers. I worked  
			as an Educator Assistant by helping the girls navigate the course, facilitating 
			group discussions over Zoom, and answering questions. Each week of the program 
			had its own theme: Art x Science, Danger!, and Mind Matters. During Art x 
			Science, they learned about the intersection of art and science and heard from 
			women currently working in both industries. Druing Danger!, the girls learned 
			about dangerous jobs within STEM, and during Mind Matters they learned about 
			careers realted to the brain and the mind.
